## Problem

Image Based (previously called Bare Metal) backup plan is designed to help customers to protect their Windows computers. It integrate with Microsoft VSS technology (Windows Shadow copy) and guarantees transactionally consistent backup. It allows administrators to exclude files from partitions as well as partitions they don't want to backup.
Backup can be restored as EC2 instance (AWS Virtual Machine), but having over 1Tb partitions can prevent this action and cause the following error message in the CloudBerry Backup console (or log files): selected partitions exceed 1TB in size. This is artificial limitation due to the nature CloudBerry uses for the restore procedure.

## Resolution

There are several scenarios, all these are based on CloudBerry restore options.

### Scenario 1

#### You have Image Based backup with boot disk over 1 Tb.

CloudBerry Restore plan can be configured with partitions resize and files / folders exclude. Both options allows to shrink target EBS volume to the size AWS can accept through the method we use for the restore. Follow the below instructions to decrease the amount of data to include into restored disk:

In the restore wizard on the "Select Partitions" make the following changes:

This step contains hidden options to 1) resize target partition; 2) exclude files / folders;
Resize your partition to 1Tb maximum (content exclusion can be helpful to exclude unnecessary data for system boot).

Once done, just follow the wizard and launch restore process. This will launch EC2 instance with your OS inside.

### Scenario 2

#### You have image based backup data disk (with no OS) over 1Tb.

This scenario requires EC2 instance with Windows OS launched in AWS Cloud. This scenario also requires CloudBerry Backup product installed into this Guest OS. Once done, sync your repository according the [following article](http://www.cloudberrylab.com/blog/how-to-continue-backup-on-another-computer/) in our blog. Those steps allows you to have your backup data listed in newly installed CloudBerry Backup. This should be image based backup (so make sure you configure storage account and select backup prefix accordingly). AWS EBS volume supports volumes from 1 GiB to 16384 GiB.

Create volume, that can fix your data and attach it to your EC2 instance. Next step is to restore our disk from images based backup as "Physical disk". Hit "Restore", select storage account with image based backup, select other options accordingly (e.g. point to restore, plan name). Make sure you select "Restore as physical disk" at the step "Type of data" to restore.

Select partitions to restore and set destination.

Complete the wizard and launch restore.
